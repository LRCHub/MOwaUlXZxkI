Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK in your area!
Yeah, yeah, yeah

After every "hi" it's a bittersweet "goodbye"
Got me crazy, got me high
Now I'm paying for the price

Ain't no answer, ain't no test
I'll be fallin' for it yes

Breathe you in like you're a drug
It's a toxic kinda love

Here I come kick in the door, uh
Comin' through, this is not war

I'm feelin' I'm feelin' the LOVE (love)
But gimme some, gimme some more

Try to forget all about me but then
I open my mouth, you're starstruck again

I got your heart pumpin' the palm of my hand
Nah, ya can't deny what was heaven and you might not get in it

Look at me, look at you
Breaking me into two
YOU'RE SMART, you know YOU ARE

Bloody eyes, bloody lies
Baby don't tell me you're "so sorry"
Like hell you are

What should I do
I hate myself for being so helpless
I'll never let you see me cry
I need to
End this love
At once and for all

Let's kill this love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum pum, pum pum, pahum
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum pum, pum pum, pahum

Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him I go boo hoo
He said you look crazy
Thank you baby
I owe it all to you

All messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

Lucky me, lucky you
In the end, all we do is lie

So what? So what?

What should I do
I hate myself for being so helpless
I'll never let you see me cry
I need to
End this love
At once and for all

Let's kill this love!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum pum, pum pum, pahum
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Rum, pum pum, pum pum, pahum

We all commit to love
That makes you cry

Oh, oh

We are all making love
That kills you inside

Yeah

We must kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love
Before it kills you too
Kill this love
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!
