Yeah-yeah-yeah
BLACKPINK in your area!
Yeah-yeah-yeah

天使が said "Hi", 結果 悪魔 said "Bye"
正気じゃ無理 so high, 吐いちゃうくらいの price
答えのない test, 騙されても, yes
ずっと感情の奴隷, 無価値な愛ね

Here I come kick in the door, oh
Act like I'm buyin' the store, oh
You better give me some love (love)
Bitch, fill it up give me some more (ah)
Feelin' like I think that I need to pray
But you need it more
Lord give me the strength
'Cause I'm at my limit and in just one minute
You gonna be visitin' heaven but might not get in it

Look at me, look at you, 苦しい？どっちが
You smart (you smart) 誰? You are
両目 涙 赤にしたら
So sorry (so sorry) 誰? You are

どうして 泣かないようにしても
いっそのこと目を伏せ
この愛 トドメ刺すきっと

Let's kill this love
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ram-papam-papam-papam
Let's kill this love
Ram-papam-papam-papam

Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him, I go boo-hoo
He said "You look crazy"
Thank you, baby, I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up, his love is my favorite
But you plus me, sadly, can be dangerous

Lucky me, lucky you, 狂言の中
We lie (we lie), so what? so what?
まして君を除外したら
So sorry (so sorry), I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)

どうして 泣かないようにしても
いっそのこと目を伏せ
この愛 トドメ刺すきっと

Let's kill this love
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ram-papam-papam-papam
Let's kill this love
Ram-papam-papam-papam

We all commit to love that makes you cry, oh
We're all making love that kills you inside, yeah

We must kill this love, yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love, before it kills you, too
Kill this love, yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love, gotta kill, let's kill this love
